	  SimpleDBus is a Lua library which enables you to write
	  simple scripts to act on signals, send signals, call methods
	  on remote objects and export your own objects to DBus.

	  SimpleDBus implements a simple poll()-based main loop
	  so scripts can act asynchronously over several busses
	  at the same time.
